Welcome to code name Yennefer

Why the name Yennefer? 
It is simple. I love the Witcher Books by  Andrzej Sapkowski, popularised by The Witcher game triology and now made into a Netflix TV series, I decided to build a PC to honor my favourite character. Yennefer of Vengerberg. If you also like the Witcher series, you can imagine this PC color scheme already. 


More background, my previous PC that I built in 2018 was running:
- CPU: AMD 1600 , 3.2GHz 6-core Processor
- Cooler: Cooler Master ML240L 
- GPU: AMD Vega 56 Sappire Pulse Edition 8GB 
- MOBO: Gigabyte B450 Aorus M Micro ATX
- RAM: Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8 GB) DDR4-3000
- PSU: EVGA 550w 80+ Gold
- Storage: Seagate 1TB 5400 RPM Hybrid HDD, HP EX900 120GB M.2 NVME SSD
- Case: Cooler Master Q300L

I was proud of this first build. It did what I wanted, most the time, game. However I sooned realised that it was extremely limited.

I remember the long nights in the bios and GPU settings tweaking it just to get the best performance for dollar. 
Overheated due to the case size and airflow restrictions. AMD GPU software was not unopitmised. The storage, though hybrid was not adequte for modern gaming. Still, it was my first build. My first love.

Now, it was time to move on.. A new PC was in order. I needed something that would... last awhile. So I schemed and there Yennefer came to mind. 

For my current build, I decided to go with;
- CPU: AMD 3700x , 3.6GHz 8-core Processor, OC to 4.4GHz
- Cooler: NZXT Kraken X73 73.11 
- GPU: MSI MECH 2X OC Radeon RX 6700 XT 12 GB Video Card
- MOBO: Asus TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (WI-FI) ATX 
- RAM: G.Skill Ripjaws V 64 GB (4 x 16 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory
- PSU: Corsair RM850x (2018) 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply
- Storage: 	Western Digital Blue 250 GB 2.5" Solid State Drive, ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro 512 GB M.2-2280 PCIe 3.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive, Silicon Power A80 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 3.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive
- Case: Fractal Design Meshify C ATX Mid Tower Case

<b>Let us begin the build !<b>

Dont be nervous, its like legos but for teenagers and adults.

Personally, I like to start with the motherboard. Its the heart of the PC that connects everything together.

I put the ram in the ram sockets, since I got 4 I filled everything, but say if you had 2 sticks, its best to space it out.

 It should look something like this. 

Next, I decided to mount the fans to my Liquid CPU cooler and just prep for when Install the CPU.

I installed the motherboard standoff screws into my case, lay the case down, installed my CPU to the motherboard. Then installed the motherboard to the case.

Do not forget the thermal paste that helps keep your CPU cool and to replace it at least once a year. Afterwards, I installed that CPU cooler to the motherboard on the CPU. It looks something like this.

If you can put the radiator on the top of your case, that would be better for cooling. However with this case, the 360mm radiator did not fit the 240mm case dimension on the top. So a front mount with the tubes on top was the only other viable solution. It is not a big deal, but from my understanding it is better for longetivity and quality of cooling. 

Okay, the fun part that EVERYONE loves... wiring. Yes, that's a joke. But, it is not that bad. I find it theraputic.

Especially when I need to plug in these USB and audio cables that my hands cant fit. Once that is out of the way. Honestly, half the battle is already won. 

![62269554436__C9D9999C-66EC-48C7-851E-91B5837931E7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109401839/212550671-7556bd0f-6aae-445b-921e-ff36a0b90078.JPG)

I decided at this point to see if the computer would boot at all. This should have been done at the initial phase of setting up the cpu, ram, and psu to the motherboard. I used a NVIDIA 750 card to just test the video output. 

It worked luckily, so I did not have to dismount everything and troubleshoot.

At this point in time, I did not hhave my 6700XT GPU, and learning from my mistake with the Liquid Cooler, I decided to measure the dimensions between the PCI port and the liquid cooler for the gpu size. 

![IMG_2124 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109401839/212550839-e6a946b6-b852-4ff5-be4d-af60b2c19946.JPG)

I used the app, "Measurement" found as a default app on iOS. 
Now its time for the cable mangement phase or just making it look pretty. The key to cable management is to always have it in mind as you build your pc and add more parts.

At this point, I really did not like the way the tubes of the Liquid Cooler was routed. I tried zip ties and just turning it around. Finally, I just decided to remount the liquid cooler to face the other way. Here is what I mean by that; 

![F7FE269B-4AD2-436C-85E4-9C8DE6040FC3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109401839/212550991-d62debb5-db38-44c9-8a3d-4cd4c5a28554.JPG)

Now, it looked much better but it added a few extra minutes because I did not think that ahead of the orientation and placement of the liquid cooler. Lesson learned for the future build. However, it worked out because I think the this tubing orientation is much better. 

Finally, my 6700XT came in and the star of the show is home.

Look at that. My second PC completed. Beautiful, Elegant, Agile, and Powerful. Of course, a few months later I wanted to get a NVIDIA 4090... but, maybe next year... Maybe 256GB ram so I can run linux on it for the joke of it. 

Oh, but we are not done yet.

I got some perhiperals, monitor, mouse, keyboard, DSLR, microphone to connect.

After everything,

This is the results.

I am proud of this one.
